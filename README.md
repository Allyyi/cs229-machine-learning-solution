# cs229 Machine Learning Solution

Stanford cs229 is a very classical course for machine learning beginners. It not only provides a broad view of machine learning but also covers both the mathematical and coding details in some important topics. The course website is http://cs229.stanford.edu/, where you can find the lecture notes and slides.

This repository contains my solution of 2018 version cs229 assignments. I have a lot of fun solving these problems. My understanding is limited, so if you find any bugs, feel free to reach me! And sorry for not providing latex version of solutions, I will update it when I'm free.
